# Week 3 Lab: Verification

## Make Note

Testing for Exercise 2
* While I have not fully implemented the test for this module this is how the test should go
* Testing each bit by bit shifting a one and getting a value
* Test the first 100 values per say
* Test the if the output is bit shifting properly -> Most Confused about the implementation of the test, not the reasoning

Since the linear Feedback register comprises of 16 bits, its not reasonable to test for every single value, rather testing to see if each bit of the register is functioning properly or not.
